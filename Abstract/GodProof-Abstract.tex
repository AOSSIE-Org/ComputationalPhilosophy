\maketitle

Attempts to prove the existence (or non-existence) of God by means of
abstract ontological arguments are an old tradition in philosophy and
theology.  G\"{o}del's proof \cite{Goedel1970} is a modern culmination of
this tradition, following particularly the footsteps of Leibniz.
%
G\"{o}del defines God as a being who possesses all \emph{positive} properties.
He does not extensively discuss what positive properties are, 
but instead he states a few reasonable but debatable axioms that they should satisfy.
Various slightly different versions of axioms and definitions have been considered by G\"{o}del and by several philosophers who commented on his proof (e.g. \cite{Scott,Sobel,AndersonGettings,Fitting,Adams,ContemporaryBibliography}). Our formalization employs the following axioms (A*) and definitions (D*):\footnote{
(A1), (A2), (A5), (D1), (D3) are logically equivalent to, respectively, axioms 5, 2 and 4 and definitions 1 and 3 in G\"odel's manuscript \cite{Goedel1970}. (A3) was introduced by Scott \cite{Scott} and could be derived from G\"odel's axiom 1 and (D1) in a logic with infinitary conjunction. (A4) is a weaker form of G\"odel's axiom 3. (D2) has an extra conjunct lacking in G\"odel's definition 2; this lack is believed to have been an oversight by G\"odel \cite{Hazen}.

\begin{description}
\item[(A1)] Any property necessarily implied by a positive property is positive: \\
       $\forall P \forall Q ((positive P \wedge (\Box \forall x (P x \Rightarrow Q x))) \Rightarrow positive Q)$
\item[(A2)] A property is positive if and only if its negation is not positive:\\
       $\forall P ((positive P) \Leftrightarrow \neg (positive \neg P))$ 
\item[(A3)] The property of being God-like is positive:
      
\item[(A4)] positive properties are necessarily positive; 
\item[(A5)] necessary existence is a positive property.
\item[(D1)] x is God-like if and only if x has every positive property, 
\item[(D2)] a property P is an essence of x if and only if P is a property of x and every property Q that x has is necessarily implied by P, 
\item[(D3)] x necessarily exists if and only if every essence of x is necessarily exemplified.
\end{description}

\noindent
From these axioms and definitions we then infer:
%
ToDo: Include formulas too??
\begin{description}
\item[(L1)] Positive properties are possibly exemplified.
\item[(L2)] Possibly God exists.
\item[(L3)] If x is God-like, then the property of being 
God-like is an essence of x.
\item[(T)] \ Necessarily God exists.
\end{description}

% From these axioms, he claims (without detailed proof) that:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item If it is possible that God exists, then it is necessary that God exists.
% \item It is possible that God exists.
% \end{enumerate}

The above variant of G\"{o}del's proof has now been 
constructed for the first-time
with an unprecedent degree of detail and formality; cf.~\cite{FormalTheologyRepository}. The following has been done (and in this order):
\begin{itemize}
\item A detailed natural deduction proof; this proof has guided our work.
%
\item A formalization of the axioms, definitions and theorems in the TPTP THF syntax \cite{J22}.
%
\item Automatic verification of the consistency of the axioms and 
definitions with Nitpick \cite{Nitpick}.
%
\item Automatic demonstration of the theorems with the provers LEO-II \cite{LEO-II} and Satallax \cite{Satallax}.

\item A step-by-step formalization using the Coq proof assistant \cite{Coq}.

\item A formalization using the Isabelle proof assistant \cite{Isabelle} where the theorems (and some additional lemmata) have been automated with Sledgehammer \cite{Sledgehammer} and Metis \cite{Hurd03first-orderproof}.
\end{itemize}

G\"{o}del's proof is challenging to formalize and verify 
because it requires very expressive logical languages with 
modal operators (\emph{possibily} and \emph{necessarily}) and higher-order quantifiers. 
Our computer-assisted formalizations rely on an embedding of the modal logic S5 
into classical higher-order logic with Henkin 
semantics \cite{J23,B9} and 
employed recently developed interactive and automated deduction tools designed for this logic.

This work attests the maturity of contemporary interactive and
automated deduction tools and opens new perspectives for a
computer-assisted theoretical philosophy.  
The critical discussion of the underlying concepts, definitions and
axioms remains a human responsibility, but the computer can assist in
building and checking rigorously correct logical arguments. In case of
logico-philosophical disputes, the computer can check the disputing
arguments and partially fulfill Leibniz' dictum: Calculemus --- Let us
calculate!

Future work includes an extensive study of other formalizations of
ontological arguments with our machinery. Variations of the
distinctive features of the base logic S5 (e.g. non-rigid symbols, 
varying domains, etc.) are enabled in these studies due
to the flexibility of the embeddings based approach.

\section{Introduction}
Without exaggeration one may claim that Kurt G\"{o}del's ontological
argument for the existence of God \cite{GoedelNotes,ScottNotes} is
amongst the most discussed formal proofs in modern literature. A rich
body of publications -- including very recent ones -- present,
discuss, assess, criticise, modify and improve G\"{o}del's original
work (see e.g.~Sobel~\shortcite{Sobel} and Oppy~\shortcite{sep-ontological-arguments} and the
references therein).  In philosophy lectures at universities the
argument is regularly presented as a masterpiece argument in
metaphysics. Since summer 2013, when Benzm\"uller and Woltzenlogel-Paleo~\shortcite{J30,C40} first
reported on their successful initial computational
analysis of the G\"odel's respectively Scott's variants of the proof,
their contribution received a media repercussion on a global scale\footnote{A
  small collection of these reports is available at {\scriptsize
    \url{https://github.com/FormalTheology/GoedelGod/blob/master/Press/LinksToNews.md}}},
and numerous bloggers commented on the proof
\cite{fuhrmann15:_blogg_goedel}.

The in-depth computational analysis presented here substantially
extends previous computer-assisted studies on G\"odel's ontological
argument. Similar to the related work \cite{J30,C40} the analysis has
been conducted with automated theorem provers for classical
higher-order logic (HOL) even though G\"odel's proof is actually
formulated in modal higher-order logic. To bridge between the two
logic formalisms we utilise and further improve the logic embeddings
approach \cite{J23,C40} as also employed in preceding related work.


The novel contributions of this paper include (but are not limited to):


\begin{itemize}
\item A detailed analysis of the inconsistency of G\"{o}del's
  \shortcite{GoedelNotes} original version of the proof is presented
  for higher-order modal logics KB and K (with possibilist and
  actualist first-order quantifiers). The extraction, reconstruction
  and verification of an informal, human intuitive argument has been
  an open problem since the first detection of this inconsistency by
  Benzmüller and Woltzenlogel-Paleo \shortcite{C40}. The experiments
  reported here led to the discovery of a surprisingly accessible
  understanding of this inconsistency which is philosophically
  profound and which has not been presented yet in the respective
  literature. The detection of this inconsistency in combination with
  the work reported here thus demonstrates that higher-order automated
  theorem provers (and thus AI systems) are capable of contributing
  new and relevant knowledge in philosophy. 
\item Another open question has been whether the G\"odel's
  respectively Scott's main theorem T3 \textit{``Necessarily, there
    exists God''} can eventually be proved fully automatically
  directly from the axioms, that is, without the need for intermediate
  argumentation steps (lemmata). Benzm\"uller and Woltzenlogel-Paleo
  \shortcite{C40} still failed in achieving this. We here report
  success for Scott's (consistent) variant of the proof in
  higher-order modal logic S5. The fully automated proof has been
  contributed by the theorem prover \textsc{Leo-II}~\cite{C26} and
  subsequently verified in the proof assistant
  Isabelle/HOL~\cite{NPW02}. On a technical level we show that the
  novel embedding of S5 is more effective than the previous one.
\item A third open issue has been whether the modal
  collapse \cite{Sobel}, which is one of the most strongly criticised
  `side-effects' of G\"odel's and Scott's variants of the proof, can
  eventually be directly verified in Isabelle/HOL. Indeed, in previous work
  the modal collapse has been confirmed by the provers
  \textsc{Satallax} \cite{Satallax} and \textsc{Leo-II}, but a
  direct verification in the highly trusted Isabelle/HOL still failed.
\item On the technical side, we present a significantly improved
  syntax representation of G\"odel's resp.~Scott's proof in
  Isabelle/HOL. In fact, we demonstrate that a nearly perfect match
  between the original pen and paper presentations and our encoding in
  Isabelle/HOl is feasible. This is clearly an important prerequisite
  for promoting the here employed theorem proving technology to
  non-expert philosophers.
\item On the other hand, we will
  also point to several technical challenges which, at least for the
  moment, still restrain non-expert users of these systems from
  independently conducting similar experiments in computational
  metaphysics as reported here and in previous work. 
% Technical issues detected within Isabelle-Sledgehammer; room for improvements
\end{itemize}

% These novel contributions are presented in Sections ? and ?.
% In Section ?, novel and previous findings are summarised and discussed 
% with regard to their relevance in metaphysics. In this section also 
% some further details and improvements on earlier 
% findings are presented.

Give paper structure (maybe not needed) ...


First successful applications of theorem proving technology in
metaphysics were reported by Oppenheimer and
Zalta~\shortcite{oppenheimera11}. They employed the first-order
\textsc{Prover9} \cite{Prover9} in their experiments. It was also
Zalta and Oppenheimer who first proposed the term
\textit{Computational Metaphysics} for this new research area. Further
related work includes Rushby's~\shortcite{rushby13} work with the
higher-order proof assistant \textsc{PVS} \cite{PVS}. Common to both
works is a significant amount of proof-hand-coding work as well as their
focus on St. Anselm's~\shortcite{Anselm} simpler, non-modal historical
version of the ontological argument.

\ldots. Different to what is presented here, none of these previous
formalises and automates variants of HOML, which is however crucial
for G\"{o}del's ontological argument.



\section{Variants of the Ontological Argument}
Short history, Anselm, Leibniz, etc.
\subsection{G\"{o}del's Proof Script}
\subsection{Scott's Variant}
\subsection{Recent Variants}
Dozens of contributions were published in the last four decades which
present variants of G\"odel's/Scott's proofs. In many cases the
motivation has been to remedy the modal collapse. Other authors are
simply interested in a critical assessment. Particularly interesting
from the perspective of this paper is that many literature
contributions unfortunately work with or refer to G''odel's original
definition of essence
$$ todo $$
This original version avoids the conjunct added by Scott expressing
that essential properties of an individual should be possessed by the
individual. As we show in this paper using this notion of essence
leads to an inconsistent axiom system, which in a classical setting of
course deserves no further attention, since from an inconsistent
system everything can be concluded, including God's existence and
non-existence simultaneously. In other words, these literature
contributions discuss variants of the argument which from a classical
logical perspective do not deserve any further attention.

We give here a list of examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item Anderson and Getting's 1996, p. 168 \cite[p.168]{AndersonGettings1968}
  use essence without conjunct.
\item  Hazen 1998, p.365 \cite[p.365]{Hazen1998} states: ``G\"odel left this
  clause out in [11], but this appears to have been an oversight--it
  is included in related manuscripts''. There is not mentioning of an
  inconsistency though.
\item Look???, p. 514
% \item Oppy 1996, p.226-227 \cite[p.226/227]{Oppy1996}, Oppy 2000, p. 364
%   \cite[p.364]{Oppy200}, Oppy 2008, p. 1068 \cite[p.1068]{Oppy2008}:
%   Oppy uses: ``A is an essence of x iff for every property B, x has B
%   neces- sarily iff A entails B'' (this is from Anderson's
%   emendation). Check is this leads to inconsistency as well. In this
%   case we may write something like: 

%  Oppy presents an critical
%   assessment in order to conclude that G\"odel's argument fails to
%   convince. Oppy apparently does not see that he is assessing an
%   inconsistent axiom system (and he in fact creates adaptations that
%   suffer the same problems).
% \item 
\end{itemize}


\footnote{Fuhrmann2005: Gödel vermerkt diese Konsequenz [dass aus der Definition unmittelbar folgt, daß alle wesentlichen
Eigenschaften notwendig äquivalent sind] in einer Fußnote zur Definition. Die Definition selbst aber läßt im Definiens das Konjunkt Xx aus. Ohne das Konjunkt folgt jedoch die Konsequenz nicht. Es ist deshalb naheliegend anzunehmen, daß Gödel die Definition so beabsichtigte, wie sie hier notiert ist und wie Gödel sie selbst in früheren Notizbucheintragungen formuliert hat.}





\section{Automating HOML in HOL}
\subsection{Outline of the Embedding}
Logic textbooks commonly utilise classical higher-order logic (HOL)
\cite{Church} as a meta-language to introduce the syntax and the
semantics of object logics of interest, in which then reasoning
problems in concrete application domains can be modeled and solved
with pen and paper.  In fact, this approach can also be followed to
enable interactive and automated proof for even very challenging
objects logics with existing theorem provers for classical
higher-order logic.

% Just as commonly the case in logic textbooks, in the embeddings
% approach classical higher-order logic is utilised as a meta-language
% to encode the syntax and the semantics of object logics in which the
% proof problems of interest are then modeled in. Modulo the embedding
% state of the art automated theorem provers for classical higher-order
% logic can then be utilised as object logic reasoning tools.

For a computational analysis of G\"odel's ontological argument in this
approach the embedding of modal higher-order logics (MHOL) such as K,
KB and S5 for different domain conditions (possibilist and actualist)
is required. This idea has been successfully followed in related work
\cite{C40}. The embedding of modal higher-order logic is in fact
straightforward. Formulas in MHOL such as are lifted to predicates
over worlds, which are explicitly represented in the approach as
terms. Propositional MHOL such as $\neg \varphi$, $\varphi\vee\psi$
and $\box \varphi$ are then mapped to HOL formulas \ldots.  

It is easy
to see that this captures the standard translation \cite{Ohlbach},
which is here (intra-logically) realised in HOL by stating a set of
equations; see also Fig. ~\ref{QMLS5}. New is that also quantifiers 
can be mapped \ldots 

The approach is very flexible, KB, S5, domain conditions\ldots 


\subsection{Improved Embedding for S5}
We present an improved embedding (syntax and defintion of box) in  Fig.~\ref{QMLS5}).
\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{./Images/QMLS5.png}}
\caption{Improved Embedding of S5} \label{QMLS5}
\end{figure}


\section{Full Automation of Scott's Proof}
Within the modified logic S5 Scott's proof can be fully automated. The
intermediate argumentation steps as not needed anymore to support the
prover, see Fig.~\ref{ScottS5}).
\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{./Images/ScottS5.png}}
\caption{Full Automation of the Ontological Argument in S5 } \label{ScottS5}
\end{figure}




In the modified S5 setting also further results can be automatically verified, which 
failed in previous work: verification of  modal collapse in
Isabelle/HOL with Meson.

\section{Intuitive Inconsistency Argument}
\subsection{LEO-II's Inaccessible Inconsistency Proof}
Tell the story (here or earlier). Show parts of LEO proof.  Inaccessible, but relevant knowledge
is contained.
\begin{figure*}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./Images/LEO-Proof.png}}
\caption{Primitive substitution in LEO-II generates candidates for the
empty property.} \label{LEO-Proof}
\end{figure*}
LEO-II's resolution proof is human unintuitive. However, it contained
relevant hints to the empty property (cf. Fig.~\ref{LEO-Proof}).

\subsection{Argument Reconstruction in Isabelle}
Present the argument informal and in Isabelle (see
Fig.~\ref{InconsistencyIsabelleK}). Easy to understand in 
in KB and KT, slightly harder in K.
\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{./Images/InconsistencyIsabelleK.png}}
\caption{Reconstruction of inconsistency in Isabelle/HOl..} \label{InconsistencyIsabelleK}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Mapping to Gödel's Script}
\begin{figure*}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./Images/Manuscript2.png}}
\caption{Sources of Inconsistence in G\"{o}del's proof script.} \label{GoedelScript}
\end{figure*}


\section{Conclusion}


Good improvement (technical sense), Sledgehammer can still be improved
(LEO-II finds inconsistency when call directly in THF Syntax, but not
from within Isabelle). Without independent experiments directly in THF 
the inconsistency would thus not have been detected.

* Moreover, weak congruence for P (see Hajek 2002, p153) needs not be postulated, since it follows from axiom A2 (again this seems another possibly new, relevant result); the argument seems actually quite trivial: A2 expresses (kind of)  weak congruence for P for entailment, and using this statement twice with swapped Phi and Psi, we get the weak congruence for P for (functional extensional) equality.

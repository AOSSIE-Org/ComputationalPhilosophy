\section{Introduction}

Ontological arguments for the existence of God can be traced back at least to St. Anselm (1033-1109). His argument considers a greatest conceivable being, who must exist, because if it did not have the property of existence, then we could conceive of a greater being that, apart from the other properties, also has the property of existence. 

A major critique of this argument is that we do not know whether the concept of greatest conceivable being in fact designates anything or if it is inconsistent, like a round square \citep{fitting}[p.134].  
%The question is if the argument is sound. 
As Bertrand Russell pointed out, the definition of greatest conceivable being allows us to define properties, like having boots, which the being then also must have \citep{citation needed}. 

Kant argued against the ontological argument on the basis that existence is not an analytic property \citep{kant}. This means that existence cannot be contained in the definition of a concept, because it is generally synthetic. The strongest claim that can be proven by the ontological argument is a conditional claim of necessary existence: if God exists, then God necessarily exists \citep{citation needed}.

St. Anselm's argument was further elaborated by Descartes and Leibniz. Leibniz identified the possible existence of God as a critical missing step in St. Anselm's argument. To fill this gap, he argued that the properties of God, the perfections, are compatible. This means that it is possible to satisfy all perfections at once which implies that 
the existence of a greatest conceivable being with all these properties is possible. 

G\"odel studied Leibniz's work \citep{Adams} and brought his ontological argument to a modern form using a modal logic with higher-order quantification over properties. In this setting, he gave precise axioms describing the notion of \emph{positive} property and defined God as a being having all positive properties. 

G\"odel's notion of positive property and Leibniz's notion of perfection differ \citep{Adams}. The main formal distinction seems to be that G\"odel's positive properties are not just atomic properties, like Leibniz's perfections, but can also consist of complex combinations of atomic properties \citep{fitting}[p.139.] (TODO: Check this claim). In particular, one of G\"odel's axioms states that any conjunction of positive properties is itself positive. From this axiom, it is immediately deduced that the property of being God-like is positive. While this step is intuitively and informally clear, it is not easily formalizable in a standard logical calculus, because it requires inferring that being God-like is a (possibly infinite) conjunction of positive properties, from the universal definition of God-likeness as the property satisfied by individuals who have all positive properties. This interplay between universal quantification (in the definition of a God-like being) and infinite conjunctions (in G\"odel's axiom for positive properties) is a technical difficulty that probably explains why, starting with Scott \cite{Scott}, to whom G\"odel confided his manuscript, this axiom of G\"odel's has been replaced by another that simply assumes the positivity of the property of being God-like. 

The main criticism against G\"odel's ontological argument is an undesirable consequence of the stipulated axioms, called \emph{modal collapse}. Many recent works \cite{todo} on the ontological argument have focused on proposing modifications of the argument that would not entail a modal collapse. This is discussed in greater detail in Section \ref{sec:collapse}, but possible solutions are not implemented in this paper.

%This axiom is unfortunately equivalent to the possibility of God's existence given the other axioms, leading to criticisms that it might be too strong \citep{sobel2}\citep{fitting}[Section 11.4. Objections.]. 

%The possibility  God's existence in turn is equivalent to  God's necessary existence as well as  God's existence itself. Thus, we have an axiom which seems to be equivalent to the conclusion. 


 % This axiom of the positiveness of conjunctions can be given a third order formulation which is the reason for the claim that third-order quantification may be required \citep{and}. %\citep{fitting}[p. 148.]   

% Another, possibly undesirable, consequence of the formalism is that there can only be one God, which is defined by the axioms. Namely, if one assumes that the theory contains the equality relation then a God has the property of being identical to itself. Since any other god-like being would have at least the same properties it shares the property of being identical to the one God. Thus, we have proved monotheism \citep{sobel2}[Ch. 4, section 3.3.2]. %\citep{fitting}[The proof is Exercise 7.1, p.163]. 

The aim of this paper is to present two detailed formal proofs of G\"odel's ontological argument \cite{Goedel} in a natural deduction calculus (as defined in Section \ref{sec:calculus}). The natural deduction style \citep{gentzen,prawitz} was chosen for three reasons. Firstly, presentations of G\"odel's proof are typically either informal or formalized in other styles of calculi (e.g. Fitting's tableaux \cite{fitting} or Sobel's sentential modal calculus \cite{sobel2}). Therefore, a formalization in natural deduction is a valuable complement to the existing presentations. Secondly, it makes the ontological proof accessible to people who are familiarized with a natural deduction style. Thirdly, as natural deduction is the style used by proof assistants such as Coq \cite{coq} and Isabelle \cite{isabelle}, the natural deduction formalizations have been easily checked step-by-step in Coq \cite{coqformalizations}.

The first contribution of this paper is a detailed formalization of Scott's version \cite{Scott} of G\"odel's ontological argument \cite{Goedel} (as shown in Section \ref{sec:scott}) in a natural deduction calculus. The second contribution of the paper is a new proof (also in natural deduction style) of the lemmas, theorems and corollaries in G\"odel's manuscript. In contrast to Scott's proofs \cite{Scott}, the proofs presented here are simpler and shorter, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.



\section{Natural Deduction}
\label{sec:calculus}

The language of higher-order modal logic used here is inspired by that of Church's simple type theory \citep{church}.

\begin{definition} \emph{Simple types} are given by the following grammar:
$$
  \theta,\tau \quad ::= \quad \mu \ \mid \ o \ \mid \ \theta \imp \tau
$$
where $\mu$ is the atomic type for individuals, $o$ is the atomic type for propositions and $\theta \imp \tau$ is the type for functions taking an argument of type $\theta$ and returning something of type $\tau$. `$\imp$' is assumed to be right associative.
\end{definition}

ToDo: decide which connectives and corresponding inference rules will be primitive.

\begin{definition} \emph{Terms and formulas} are given by the following grammar:
\begin{align*}
 s,t \quad ::= \quad & 
  p_\tau \ \mid \ 
  X_\tau \ \mid \
  (\lambda X_\theta.s_\tau)_{\theta\imp\tau} \ \mid \ 
  (s_{\theta\imp\tau}\, t_\theta)_\tau \ \mid \\
& \bot_o \ \mid \
  \imp_{o\imp o\imp o} \ \mid \ 
  \wedge_{o\imp o\imp o} \ \mid \
  \vee_{o\imp o\imp o} \ \mid \\
& \all_{(\tau\imp o)\imp o} \ \mid \ 
  \ex_{(\tau\imp o)\imp o} \ \mid \
  \nec_{o\imp o} \ \mid \
  \pos_{o\imp o}
\end{align*}
where $p_\tau$ and $X_\tau$ range over, respectively, constants and variables of type $\tau$. Parenthesis conventions, infix notation for propositional connectives and binding notation for quantifiers are assumed. Furthermore, subscript types are omitted when they are clear from the context. Negation ($\neg_{o\imp o}$) and equivalence ($\biimp_{o\imp o\imp o}$) are defined by $\neg A\equiv A\imp \bot$ and $ (A\biimp B)\equiv (A\imp B)\wedge (B\imp A)$.
\end{definition}

ToDo: decide if rules for diamond should be added.


The natural deduction calculus used here has standard rules for propositional connectives and quantifiers, as shown in Figures \ref{fig:PropositionalRules} and \ref{fig:QuantifierRules}. The extension to classical logic is achieved by adding a rule for double negation elimination, shown in Figure \ref{fig:Classical}. Finally, modal operators are handled by special rules that insert or remove formulas from boxes, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:NDK}. Apart from the use of labels and the dual rules for `$\pos$', these rules are essentially the modal rules from \cite{todo}. Beta-reduction is implicit; all rules are assumed modulo beta-reduction. A \emph{derivation} is a directed acyclic graph whose nodes are formulas and whose edges correspond to applications of the inference rules. A \emph{proof} of a formula $F$ is a derivation without open assumptions and having $F$ as root not inside any box. 

Double lines are used to abbreviate tedious propositional reasoning steps in the derivations. Dashed lines are used to refer to an axiom or theorem with proof shown elsewhere. Dotted lines are used to indicate folding and unfolding of definitions. Furthermore, as it is inconvenient to draw boxes around large derivations in \LaTeX, formulas inside boxes are labeled with the names of the boxes surrounding them. Therefore, the boxes can be omitted without loss of information.

\subsection{Suitability for Rigid Higher-Order Modal Logic K}

Adding the modal rules results in a calculus that is suitable for the basic modal logic \textbf{K}.
In other words, {\NDK} is sound and complete relative to {\ND} extended with axiom K ($\nec(A\imp B)\imp (\nec A\imp \nec B)$) and the necessitation rule (which establishes that $\nec A$ is a theorem if $A$ is a theorem).


\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:completeness}
{\NDK} is complete, relative to {\ND} extended with axiom K and the necessitation rule.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The necessitation rule can be immediately simulated with the $\nec_I$ rule. Axiom K can be derived in {\NDK} as shown below:

\begin{small}
\begin{prooftree}
\AXC{$ $}\RightLabel{2}
\UIC{$\nec(A\imp B)$}\RightLabel{$\nec_E$}
\UIC{$\omega: A\imp B$}

   \UIC{$ \nec B$} \RightLabel{$\imp_I^1$}
   \UIC{$\nec A\imp \nec B$} \RightLabel{$\imp_I^2$}
   \UIC{$\nec(A\imp B)\imp (\nec A\imp \nec B)$}
\end{prooftree}
\end{small}


\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:soundness}
{\NDK} is sound, relative to {\ND} extended with axiom K and the necessitation rule.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
It is necessary to show that {\NDK} proofs of the following form can be translated to proofs in {\ND} extended with the axiom K and the necessitation rule.

\begin{small}
$$
\infer[\nec_I]{\nec B}{
\infer{\omega: B}{
  \infer{\vdots}{\infer[\nec_E]{\omega: A_1}{\nec A_1}} &
  \ldots & 
  \infer{\vdots}{\infer[\nec_E]{\omega: A_n}{\nec A_n}}}
}
$$
\end{small}

\noindent
A translation to {\ND} extended with axiom K and necessitation is shown below for the case when $n=1$:

 % Assuming the axiom K and the necessitation rule $\Box_I$, the open formula $\nec A $ and the existence of a derivation of $ B$ from the open assumption $ A$, then we can derive $\nec B$ without the rules for boxed parts of derivations.

\begin{small}
\begin{prooftree}
\AXC{$ $}\RightLabel{1}
\UIC{$A_1$}\noLine
\UIC{$\vdots$}\noLine
\UIC{$ B$} \RightLabel{$\imp_I^1$}
\UIC{$A_1\imp B$} \RightLabel{necessitation}

        \AXC{$\nec A_1 $}\RightLabel{$\imp_E$}
    \BIC{$\nec B$}
\end{prooftree}
\end{small}

\noindent
For $n > 1$, the translation is a straightforward generalization:

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{prooftree}

\UIC{$A_1$}\noLine

\UIC{$\nec(A_1\imp \ldots \imp A_n\imp B)$}
      \AXC{Axiom K, iterated}\doubleLine\dashedLine
      \UIC{$\nec(A_1\imp \ldots \imp A_n\imp B)\imp (\nec A_1\imp \ldots \imp \nec A_n\imp \nec B)$} \RightLabel{$\imp_E$}
  \BIC{$\nec A_1\imp \ldots \imp \nec A_n\imp \nec B$}
\end{prooftree}
\end{scriptsize}

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{prooftree}
  \AXC{$ $} \dashedLine
  \UIC{$\nec A_1\imp \ldots \imp \nec A_n\imp \nec B$}
        \AXC{$\nec A_1 \quad \ldots \quad \nec A_n$} \doubleLine \RightLabel{$\imp_E$}
    \BIC{$\nec B$}
\end{prooftree}
\end{scriptsize}

\end{proof}

Without the restriction that every box must be accessed by exactly one strong modal inference, the calculus would be unsound for the modal logic \textbf{K}, because the formula $\all \psi. (\nec \psi \imp \pos \psi)$ would be derivable although it is not valid in \textbf{K}.

\begin{prooftree}
  \AXC{$ $} \RightLabel{1}
  \UIC{$\nec \psi$} \RightLabel{$\nec_E$}
        \UIC{$\omega: \psi$} \RightLabel{$\pos_I$}
        \UIC{$\pos \psi$} \RightLabel{$\imp_I^1$}
    \UIC{$\nec \psi \imp \pos \psi$} \RightLabel{$\forall_I$}
    \UIC{$\all \psi. (\nec \psi \imp \pos \psi)$}
\end{prooftree}

This example of an unsound derivation is prevented by the eigen-box condition because the box labelled by $\omega$ is not accessed by any strong inference. 


The straightforward combinations of the quantifier rules of {\ND} either with the modal rules of {\NDK} or with axiom K and the necessitation rule are suitable for a higher-order modal logic where constants and variables are \emph{rigid}. From the point of view of a \emph{possible worlds} semantics, rigidity means that their interpretation is independent of the world in which they are being interpreted. Rigidity is silently assumed by most works investigating the ontological argument, and is explicitly assumed here. Nevertheless, it should be noted that its adequacy has already been contested \cite{fitting}.

ToDo: Talk about constant domains and varying domains, mention Conchiarella's semantics and Anderson's footnote 14.

\section{Some Derivable Modal Principles}
\label{sec:AxiomB}.

As mentioned in \citep{and90}[Footnote 5], there are sources that discuss what modal principles are needed for the ontological argument. The standard system for the argument is S5. Through an analysis of the proofs weaker systems, in particular KB, can be shown to be sufficient for versions of the ontological argument \citep{sobel2}[p. 152]. The proof presented in Section \ref{sec:newproof} is such a version and explicitly shows a single use of Brouwer Reduction Principle, which, in turn, is provable from axiom B. All other proof steps are formalizable in a basic second-order modal logic K. 

In standard first-order modal logics the modal axioms correspond to geometric conditions on the frames of Kripke models \citep{negri}. The modal axiom {\bf T} corresponds to reflexivity of the frame and {\bf B} corresponds to symmetry of the frame. The frames of the modal logic {\bf S5} are in addition transitive. 


%G\"odel mentions in the notes which are saved of his proof that the modal system required for proving his theorem is a second order version of the modal system {\bf S5}. In \citep{and90} it is conjectured that the principles of proof could be restricted to the weaker modal logic {\bf KB}. The modal logic {\bf KB} consists of the basic modal system {\bf K} and the modal axioms {\bf T} and {\bf B}.

\subsection{A modal distribution principle in K}

To prove G\"odel's ontological proof in natural deduction we use a modal distribution principle derivable in K and  Brouwer's reduction theorem derivable from the modal Axiom B. 

\begin{lemma}\label{DP}
The distribution principle 
$$\nec (A\imp B)\imp(\pos A\imp \pos B)$$
is provable in our system K of modal logic.

\subsection{Axiom B and Brouwer's Reduction Principle}


Brouwer's reduction theorem is a version of axiom B for modal logic and a property that enforces symmetry as a geometric property for the frame of a Kripke sematics. 


\begin{lemma}\label{BRP}
The Brouwer Reduction Principle $\pos\nec A\imp A$ is derivable from axiom B, $A\imp \nec \pos A$.

\setcounter{axiom}{0}
\setcounter{lemma}{0}
\setcounter{theorem}{0}
\setcounter{corollary}{0}
\setcounter{definition}{0}

ToDo: natural language explanation of the proof in Anderson.

The acceptance of the correctness of the ontological argument by G\"odel's work boils down to the intuitive correctness of the axioms and definitions and the belief in the soundness of the deductive system. The formal argument of G\"odel is based on Leibniz proof, which in turn is based on Descartes proof. These proofs have two parts; a proof that if the exemplification of the god-likeness property is possible, then it is necessary and a proof that the exemplification is in fact possible. 


\begin{axiom}
\label{A1}
Either a property or its negation is positive, but not both:
$$
\all \varphi. [P(\neg \varphi) \biimp \neg P(\varphi)]
$$
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}
\label{A2}
A property necessarily implied by a positive property is positive:
$$
\all \varphi. \all \psi.[(P(\varphi) \wedge \nec \all x.[\varphi(x) \imp \psi(x)]) \imp P(\psi)]
$$
\end{axiom}


\begin{theorem}
\label{T1}
Positive properties are possibly exemplified:
$$
P(\varphi) \imp \pos \ex x.\varphi(x)
$$

\section{New Proof}\label{sec:newproof}

A outline of the proof is that firstly all positive properties are proven to be possibly exemplified (Theorem \ref{T1}). Then this theorem is applied to the property of god-likeness, thus showing the possible existence of a god-like being (Corollary \ref{C1}). In Lemma \ref{L1} it is classically proven that the hypothetically assumed existence of a god-like being implies that the existence is necessary. Lastly, the necessary existence of a god-like being is proven (Theorem \ref{T2}) from Corollary \ref{C1} and Lemma \ref{L1} by properties of the modal system. The properties required for the proof are the distribution principle and Brouwer's reduction theorem mentioned in Section \ref{sec:AxiomB}. The proof of Theorem \ref{T2} follows the proof of Sobel \citep{sobel2}[p. 126--127].

\subsection{God necessarily exists}

The exemplification of the god-likeness property is provable from its possible exemplification by the modal distribution principle \ref{DP} and Brouwer's reduction principle \ref{BRP}. The necessary exemplification of the god-likeness property can then be deduced from lemma \ref{L1}. This single use of the modal distribution principle \ref{DP} and Brouwer's reduction principle \ref{BRP} follows the presentation of in Sobel \citep{sobel2}[p.126--127]. 

\setcounter{theorem}{2}

\section{Modal collapse} \label{sec:collapse}

A major criticism against G\"odel's proof is that its axioms lead to the so-called \emph{modal collapse} \citep{sobel}: it is possible to prove that everything that is the case is so necessarily, and hence actuality, possibility and necessity coincide \citep{sobel2}[Ch. 4,  section 6, theorems 9 and 10]. That is: for all properties, $\varphi$, 
$$\varphi \biimp \pos \varphi \biimp \nec \varphi
$$
If G\"odel's ontological proof is abstractly analysed, then we are proving a restricted modal collapse, which applies to one specific formula, the exemplification of god-likeness. In addition we prove and that the definition of god-likeness is sound, which means that it is possibly exemplified. Thus, the necessity of the formula follows. The interest in the proof naturally decreases if a consequence of the axiomatization is a modal collapse for all formulas. Therefore, an improvement would be obtained if the modal collapse was limited to one property, namely the property of god-likeness. A number of solutions to the problem of the modal collapse have been proposed. 

Anderson's solution \citep{citation needed} modifies the definitions of god-like being and essence, and eliminates half of an axiom. This not only avoids the modal collapse, but also makes two of G\"odel's five axioms derivable from the others \citep{hajek} under some implicit additional assumptions \citep{fuhrmann}. Another solution involving more substantial modifications is that of Bj{\o}rdal \citep{bjordal,fuhrmann}. 

On another track, Fitting has argued that greater care has to be taken with the semantics of higher-order modal logics. Quantified variables may be rigid or flexible; and properties may be treated as intensional or extensional. Making the right choices may prevent the modal collapse \citep{fitting}[Sections 11.9 and 11.10].

Anderson \citep{and90}[p. 292] and Sobel \citep{sobel2}[p. 133] also discuss the idea that the notion of property over which quantification is allowed might be too general and restrictions might be appropriate.  

It is beyond the scope of this paper to analyze these solutions in detail or propose new solutions. The purpose of this section is simply to show natural deduction derivations of the modal collapse, thus confirming that it holds for the axioms used in the previous sections.


\begin{theorem}
\label{T3}
For all constant formulas, $A$, (without free variables) a modal collapse

A \imp \nec A

is provable.

% The question arises what kind of second order quantification is allowed. The instantiations that are used in our proof are instantiated with predicate variables that later work as eigenvariables for the second order universal introduction. In the proof of corollary \ref{C1} we instantiate with $G$ and in the proof of lemma \ref{L1}. we instantiate with $G$ and $E$. %In Sobel on G\"{o}del's ontological proof by Robert E. Koons this question is raised.

% One can also discuss if a second order modal logic is sound and complete. With Henkin models, which restrict the second order quantification with comprehension, we have that normal second order logic is sound and complete. There is a completeness proof for a second order modal logic found in A completeness theorem in second order modal logic by Cocchiarella.





 







\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}

The proofs of theorem T1 and corollary C1 ($\pos \ex x. G(x)$) do not rely on equality and use axiom A2 ($\all \varphi. \all \psi.[(P(\varphi) \wedge \nec \all x.[\varphi(x) \imp \psi(x)]) \imp P(\psi)]$) only once. 
Corollary C2 ($\ex x. G(x)$), which is usually regarded as a trivial corollary of main theorem T3 ($\nec \ex x. G(x)$) using the modal logic axiom T, is here derived directly from lemma L1 and corollary C1, not relying on T. The main theorem T3 becomes derivable from C2 by a single application of the necessitation rule. Furthermore, all proofs are done in the modal logic K, except for the proof of corollary C2, which requires one use of the axiom B of modal logic KB.

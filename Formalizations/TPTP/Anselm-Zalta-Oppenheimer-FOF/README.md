# TPTP Translation of Oppenheimer & Zalta 's Formalization of Anselm's Ontological Argument

Paul E. Oppenheimer and Edward N. Zalta formalized Anselm's ontological argument in a second-order logic with definite descriptions. To verify the logical validity of their formalization, they embedded their logic into first-order logic and encoded the formalization as [theorem proving problems in Prover9 syntax](http://mally.stanford.edu/cm/ontological-argument/). Geoff Sutcliffe and Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo translated these problems to TPTP syntax. The translated files can be found in this folder and also in version 7.0.0 of the [TPTP](http://www.tptp.org/) library.

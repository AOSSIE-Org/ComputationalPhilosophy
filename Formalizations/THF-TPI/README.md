Goedel's Ontological Proof in TPTP THF-TPI
==========================================

Authors: Christoph Benzmueller and Bruno Woltzenlogel-Paleo (November 7, 2013)

This directory contains a development of Goedel's ontological argument
(and some further result) in TPTP THF. The development is related to
the work presented in
https://github.com/FormalTheology/GoedelGod/tree/master/Formalizations/THF.
However, the work presented here uses the new TPTP TPI proof scripting
language.  For more information on this scripting language see
http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/TPTP/Proposals/TPILanguage.html.

There is only one relevant file, namely GoedlGod.tpi, and this file
can be executed with the tpii interpreter available at
http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/cgi-bin/SystemB4TPTP


Best regards,

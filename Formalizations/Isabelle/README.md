Ontological Proofs in Isabelle/HOL
=================================

Authors: Christoph Benzmueller and Bruno Woltzenlogel-Paleo

This directory contains formalizations of 
GÃ¶del's ontological argument in 
[Isabelle/HOL](http://isabelle.in.tum.de/). 
There are actually several variants of the ontological
argument, and here they are organized in subdirectories
named after the authors who proposed or discussed them
(e.g. Scott, Anderson, Bjordal, ...).

The subdirectory "Meta" contains general research results that
are not specific to any variant. The subdirectory "Drafts" contains
ongoing research that is still too preliminary.

All files in this directory are constantly being improved.
If you do not find a file mentioned by one of our papers,
please contact us.

Best regards,

Christoph Benzmueller and Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo

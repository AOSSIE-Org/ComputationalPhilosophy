Dipl.-Ing. MM.Sc. Dr. techn. Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo studied electronics engineering in the Brazilian Air Force's Technological Institute of Aeronautics. In 2005 he joined the Erasmus Mundus M.Sc. in Computational Logic at TU-Dresden and completed it at TU-Wien in 2007. In 2008, he obtained his second M.Sc. degree, in Computer Science, in Brazil. In 2009, he finished his Ph.D. in the field of Logic at TU-Wien, and then went to France for a post-doc at INRIA-Nancy. He returned to the Theory and Logic group of the Institute for Computer Languages at the TU-Wien in 2011. During holidays in Brazil in early 2013, he faced an unusually difficult situation and employed his skills in automated and interactive theorem proving to theology as a gift to those who prayed for him to overcome it.

We present a formalization and (partial) automation of Goedel's
ontological argument in quantified modal logic S5 (QML S5). QML S5 is in 
turn modeled as a fragment of Church's simple type theory (HOL). Thus, the
formalization is essentially a formalization in HOL. For our encoding
of HOL formulas we employ the TPTP THF0 syntax. For more information
on this syntax we refer to:

-- Automated Reasoning in Higher-Order Logic using the TPTP THF 
   Infrastructure (Geoff Sutcliffe, Christoph Benzmüller), In Journal 
   of Formalized Reasoning, volume 3, number 1, pp. 1-27, 2010.

Automated theorem provers and model finders for HOL (LEO-II, Satallax and 
Nitpick) are employed to 
- show the consistency of the axioms and definitions employed
- to automate the ontological argument in 4 (resp. 5) single steps

The set of axioms and definitions considered is as follows:

 (axiom_1) Any property strictly implied by a positive property is positive.
 (axiom_2) A property is positive if and only if its negation is not positive.
 (def_1)   X is God-like if and only if X incorporates all positive properties.
 (axiom_3) The property of being God-like is positive.
 (def_2)   Property P is an essence of X if and only if P is a property of X 
           and every property Q that X has is strictly implied by P.
 (axiom_4) Positive properties are necessary positive properties.
 (def_3)   X necessarily exists if and only if every essence of X is necessarily 
           exemplified.
 (axiom_5) Necessary existence is positive.


Informal explanation of the automation of Goedel's arguments:

The consistency of this set of axioms in our formalization can be
shown in about 7 seconds by Nitrox (Nitpick); see file 
GoedelGod_consistentAssumptions.p

Step 1:  
We show (lemma_1): Positive properties are eventually exemplified.
It holds:
  (axiom_1), (axiom_2) |- (lemma_1)
This can be proved by LEO-II and Satallax much less than second; see 
GoedelGod_lemma_1.p
Remark: only the left to right direction of (axiom_2) is required here.

Step 2: 
We show (lemma_2): Eventually God exists.
It holds:
  (axiom_2), (lemma_1), (def_1), (axioms_3) |- (lemma_2) 
This can be proved by LEO-II and Satallax much less than second; see 
GoedelGod_lemma_2.p
Remark: only the left to right direction of (axiom_2) is required here.

Step 3: 
We show (lemma_3): If X is a God-like being, then the property of being 
God-like is an essence of X.
It holds:
  (axiom_2), (def_1), (def_2), (axiom_4) |- (lemma_3)
This can be proved by LEO-II and Satallax quickly; see GoedelGod_lemma_3.p. 
LEO-II needs about 18 seconds and Satallax about 3 seconds.
Remark: both directions of (axiom_2) are required here; otherwise Nitrox 
(Nitpick) finds a counterexample.

Step 4: 
We show (theorem_1): Necessarily God exists.
It holds:
  (def_1), (lemma_2), (lemma_3), (def_3), (axiom_5) |- (theorem_1)
This can be proved by LEO-II and Satallax quickly; see GoedelGod_theorem_1.p. 
LEO-II needs about 23 seconds and Satallax about 3 seconds.

Step 5: 
We show (corrollary_1): God exists.
It holds:
  (theorem_1) |- (corollary_1)
This can be proved by LEO-II and Satallax much less than second; see 
GoedelGod_corollary_1.p



In the experiments above the provers were run with a 60 seconds timeout via 
Geoff Sutcliffe's SystemOnTPTP interface on standard PCs; big thanks to Geoff!

We are currently testing whether (theorem_1) can eventually be proved
directly from the axioms and definitions in one step; see file 
GoedelGod_theorem_1_oneStep.p. So far the provers failed.


The employed embedding of QML in HOL is adapting the ideas as presented in 

-- Quantified Multimodal Logics in Simple Type Theory (Christoph Benzmueller, 
   Lawrence Paulson), In Logica Universalis (Special Issue on Multimodal 
   Logics), volume 7, number 1, pp. 7-20, 2013. 

and in 

-- Exploring Properties of Normal Multimodal Logics in Simple Type Theory 
   with LEO-II (Christoph Benzmueller, Lawrence Paulson), Chapter in Reasoning 
   in Simple Type Theory --- Festschrift in Honor of Peter B. Andrews on His 
   70th Birthday (Christoph Benzmueller, Chad Brown, Joerg Siekmann, Richard 
   Statman, eds.), College Publications, Studies in Logic, Mathematical Logic 
   and Foundations, pp. 386-406, 2008.

Note that our QML formalization employs quantification over individuals and 
quantification over sets of individuals.
